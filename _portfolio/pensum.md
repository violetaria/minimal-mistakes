### Final Project for CodePath

Pensum is an android app that allows a user to post tasks they need help with, bid on tasks, view and edit user profiles, as well as chatting with task candidates. The app utilizes Parse and Zip Code API.

I worked on a team with two other developers and spent 3.5 weeks making the project.
