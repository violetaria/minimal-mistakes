### Final Project for Iron Yard

Flour Power is a recipe app/website which allows users to import recipes through a public API (Spoonacular) or through OCR technology (rtesseract).  The recipes can be saved and viewed through the mobile device which has the capability of reading the recipes to you!  Saved recipes are searchable by name or ingredient.

I worked on a team with two other front end developers and spent 2 weeks making the project.
