     I'm a developer with solid roots in performance testing and a passion for solving puzzles.  My strengths include strong analytical skills, the ability to understand applications built on a variety of architectures, and solid communication skills from years of work as a consultant (remote and onsite).  My most recent obsessions are Ruby, Rails, Android, Raspberry Pi, Javascript, and CSS.

      Over the years, I've truly begun to enjoy public speaking and am proud to have spoken at three conferences.  I'm looking forward to future speaking opportunities as I progress in my development career.  </p>

        At my previous job, I was tasked with training all new performance testers (who often started with minimal testing background).  That experience led me to search for ways to continue mentoring as I moved out of performance testing and into development.   Luckily, I found the GT MentorJackets program and have been volunteering as a mentor for the past two years.

      When I'm not sitting at my computer doing programmer things, I enjoy cooking and playing board games with my husband Yang and hanging out with our mini bull terrier Allie (gator).
